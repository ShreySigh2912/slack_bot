# Slack URL Verification Fix - Deployment Guide

## Problem
Slack was showing the error:
> "Your request URL didn't respond with the value of the challenge parameter."

## Solution
The server now explicitly handles Slack's URL verification challenge and responds with JSON format: `{ "challenge": "<value>" }`

## What Changed

### Fixed `/slack/events` Endpoint
- **Explicitly handles URL verification**: When Slack sends `type: "url_verification"`, the server immediately responds with `{ "challenge": "<challenge_value>" }` in JSON format
- **Proper event processing**: Event callbacks are acknowledged immediately and processed asynchronously by Bolt
- **Raw body parsing**: Uses `express.raw()` to preserve the raw body for Slack's signature verification
- **Enhanced logging**: All events are logged with emoji indicators for easy debugging

### Key Code Changes in `index.js`
1. **URL Verification** (lines 62-67):
   ```javascript
   if (body.type === 'url_verification') {
     return res.status(200).json({ challenge: body.challenge });
   }
   ```

2. **Event Processing** (lines 70-101):
   - Acknowledges immediately with 200 OK
   - Processes events asynchronously with Bolt handlers
   - Logs success/errors for debugging

3. **Comprehensive logging**:
   - üì• = Incoming request
   - ‚úÖ = Success/verification
   - üì© = Event callback
   - ‚ùå = Error
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è = Info

## Deploy to Render

### Step 1: Commit and Push
```bash
git add index.js
git commit -m "Fix Slack URL verification with JSON response"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Render Auto-Deploy
- If you have auto-deploy enabled, Render will automatically rebuild
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify in Slack
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Event Subscriptions
2. The Request URL field should now show: `https://slack-bot-1-5oui.onrender.com/slack/events`
3. Click "Retry" or re-enter the URL and save
4. You should see: ‚úÖ "Verified"

### Step 4: Check Render Logs
```
üì• Received Slack request: type = "url_verification"
‚úÖ URL verification challenge received: <challenge_string>
```

## Testing Locally

### 1. Start the server
```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
üöÄ ========================================
‚úÖ  admission-bot is RUNNING on port 3000
üöÄ ========================================

üìç Slack Events URL: https://slack-bot-1-5oui.onrender.com/slack/events
üîç Healthcheck: GET http://localhost:3000/

‚ú® Ready to receive Slack events!
   - URL verification will respond with JSON
   - Events will be processed by Bolt handlers
```

### 2. Test URL verification locally
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/slack/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"url_verification","challenge":"test123"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{"challenge":"test123"}
```

### 3. Test healthcheck
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

Expected: `admission-bot up`

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Render:
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` - From Slack App Basic Information
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Starts with `xoxb-`
- `ANNOUNCE_CHANNEL_ID` - Channel where users join
- `BATCH2_CHANNEL_ID` - Batch 2 destination channel
- `BATCH3_CHANNEL_ID` - Batch 3 destination channel
- `PORT` - Automatically set by Render

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid signature"
- **Cause**: `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is incorrect or missing
- **Fix**: Copy the correct signing secret from Slack App ‚Üí Basic Information

### Issue: "Not receiving events"
- **Cause**: Event subscriptions not configured
- **Fix**: Enable events in Slack App ‚Üí Event Subscriptions:
  - `member_joined_channel`
  - `message.im`

### Issue: "Bot not responding to DMs"
- **Cause**: Missing bot scopes
- **Fix**: Add these scopes in Slack App ‚Üí OAuth & Permissions:
  - `chat:write`, `im:write`, `im:history`, `users:read`
  - `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `channels:manage`, `groups:write`

### Issue: "Already in channel" errors
- **Cause**: Bot is not a member of destination channels
- **Fix**: Invite the bot to all three channels:
  - `#program_announcement` (or your ANNOUNCE_CHANNEL_ID)
  - `#batch-2` (or your BATCH2_CHANNEL_ID)
  - `#batch-3` (or your BATCH3_CHANNEL_ID)

## Logs to Look For

### Successful URL Verification
```
üì• Received Slack request: type = "url_verification"
‚úÖ URL verification challenge received: 3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P
```

### Successful Event Processing
```
üì• Received Slack request: type = "event_callback"
üì© Event callback received: event_type = "member_joined_channel"
‚úÖ Event processed successfully
```

### User Flow
```
üì© Event callback received: event_type = "member_joined_channel"
‚úÖ Event processed successfully
üì© Event callback received: event_type = "message"
‚úÖ Event processed successfully
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Express server**: Manual setup for full control over URL verification
- **Slack Bolt**: Used for event handling (`app.event`, `app.message`)
- **Raw body middleware**: Required for Slack's signature verification
- **Asynchronous processing**: Events acknowledged immediately, processed async
- **In-memory state**: `dmState` Map tracks user conversation flow
- **No database**: Simple deployment, state doesn't persist across restarts

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Deploy the fixed code
2. ‚úÖ Verify URL in Slack Event Subscriptions
3. ‚úÖ Test by joining the announcement channel
4. ‚úÖ Verify DM conversation flow works
5. ‚úÖ Confirm user gets invited to correct batch channel

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Slack Event Subscriptions shows "‚úÖ Verified"
- [ ] Render logs show URL verification success
- [ ] New users joining announcement channel receive DM
- [ ] Bot collects name and batch correctly
- [ ] Users are invited to correct batch channel
- [ ] No Slack retry loops in logs
